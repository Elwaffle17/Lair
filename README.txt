Lia Noir - Mobile One-Page Site (Local)
--------------------------------------
Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- assets/logo.svg
- assets/poster.webp (placeholder SVG saved as .webp)

Instructions:
1) Unzip the package.
2) Open index.html in your browser (double-click). For best results serve via a simple local server:
   - Python 3: python -m http.server 8000
   - Then open http://localhost:8000 in your mobile emulator or device.
3) Replace assets/poster.webp with your optimized .webp image and assets/logo.svg with your logo.
4) If you later want to include a hero video, replace poster with a <video> element in index.html and update script.js.

Note: poster.webp is a placeholder SVG saved with .webp extension. Replace with a real .webp for production.
